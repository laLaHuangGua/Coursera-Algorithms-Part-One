## Coursera: Algorithms, Part 1

### Outline

---

This repo contains my assignment codes and notes about my path to solving those assignments.

**WARNING**: I am not good at writing English, but I want to practice. You may see some syntax errors in my README file or annotations, and you may come across Chinglish. I would appreciate it if you could figure out that.

### Finished
